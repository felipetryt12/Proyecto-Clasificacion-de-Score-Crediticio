# Credit Score Classification Project

This project aims to develop a classification model to predict customers' credit scores based on their financial and behavioral characteristics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files, which are detailed below:

### Directory Structure, Folder, and File Descriptions

- **`__pycache__/`**: Contains cache files automatically generated by Python to speed up execution.
- **`.conda/`**: May contain specific configurations related to Conda environments.
- **`.vscode/settings.json`**: Custom configuration for Visual Studio Code that affects the development environment.
- **`PROYECTO/data/`**: Folder that stores both raw (`raw`) and processed (`processed`) data.
- **`PROYECTO/models/`**: Stores trained models and example scripts for their use.
  - **`Prediccion_score_c_rf.pkl`**: Trained and saved Random Forest model.
  - **`Ejemplo.py`**: Example script to load and use the saved model.
- **`PROYECTO/src/`**: Contains all the source code and scripts necessary for data handling, model training, and analysis.
  - **`data/`**: Scripts related to the creation, loading, and management of databases.
  - **`Exploracion_datos/`**: Notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and feature generation.
  - **`models_training/`**: Notebooks dedicated to training, optimizing, and evaluating classification models.
  - **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions that are used throughout the project.
  - **`.env`**: File where environment variables are stored, such as API keys or sensitive configurations (excluded in `.gitignore`).
  - **`.gitignore`**: List of files and folders that should not be uploaded to the Git repository.
  - **`README.es.md`**: Spanish version of the README file.
  - **`README.md`**: Main README file.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repository-URL>`
2. **Set up the environment**: It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. **Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Use the notebooks in `Exploracion_datos/` to understand and preprocess the data.
4. **Model Training**:
   - The notebooks in `models_training/` contain the process of model selection and optimization.
5. **Deployment**:
   - The final trained model is located in `PROYECTO/models/Prediccion_score_c_rf.pkl` and can be loaded and used as shown in `Ejemplo.py`.
